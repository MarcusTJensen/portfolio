        `This project was the exam in a course called "Interface design". 
        Here we were tasked with developing a application in groups. The application was going to be a 
        24 hour travel guide for asian tourists in Oslo.`,
        `We worked on the project for 2 months and worked agile using Scrum. It was also expected that we
        user tested the application. To achieve this we tested it on both students and actual tourists in Oslo.`,
        `The course was mainly about learning how to create a good user experience and user interface.
        This was also the most important for the project. We therefore spent a lot of time developing a good user experience
        and interface. The project is developed using the Ionic framework which is based on TypeScript and Angular.`
