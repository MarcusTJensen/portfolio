        `In this exam i was tasked with creating an app that displayed the top 50 albums of all time.
        I was given an API where i could retrieve the top 50 albums and the associated meta data.`,
        `The home screen had to contain two different representations of the albums. One where you could see
        the album artwork, and another with just text in a more compact list. Each album also had to naviagate
        you to a detail page where you could see all of the songs.`,
        `It was also mandatory that i implemented functionality that let the users search for an album.
        In addition to this the application also needed to have a screen for your favourited songs.
        In this screen you can rearrange and delete favourited songs, aswell as getting recommendations based on which songs you have added.`,
        `The API that was used in the exam is no longer free. This is the reason for the dummy data in the screenshots.`
