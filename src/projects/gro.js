        {item :<p>In the last semester of my studies we carried out a bachelor project in groups. My group developed a mobile application for Deloitte digital.
        The main goal of the application is to motivate rehabilitation patients through their process. The application is developed with React Native,
        and we worked agile using Scrum.
        </p>},
        <p>Throughout the project we worked tightly with Sunnaas hospital in Oslo. Sunnaas hospital specializes in rehabilitation, which provided us
        with the possibility of testing on real users.
        </p>,
        <p>While developing the application Deloitte also provided us with help from one of their designers. The designer was very involved
        through the entire project, and teached us about different design processes and how to come up with a good design.
        From this project i learned a lot about how IT projects are carried out in the industry, and it has prepared me well for working life.
