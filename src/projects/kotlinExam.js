        `This exam consisted of two individual apps. A Tic Tac Toe app and another more complex application.
        The exam had some specifications as to how the application should be developed.
        The application had to be developed using a Fragment-architecture, and it had to make use of an external API.
        The application also nedded to have a local database, which i achieved through implementing the Room database.`,
        `In addition to this I needed to make sure the application used some sort of sensor data. My application 
        uses the accelerometer sensor. There was no specifications as to what theme i had to use for the application.
        I was free to make it whatever i wanted, as long as i covered the specifications i mentioned.
        I decided to develop a fantasy football application for the norwegian "Obos ligaen"(second division).`,
        `This was the first app i created on my own and from this I learned a lot about app development,
        which has helped me in the later stages of my studies.`
