const AboutMe = 
    `I am a developer based in Oslo. I have a bachelors degree in frontend- and mobile development from Kristiania university college.
    Throughout my studies i have learned a lot of different technologies within frontend development.
    Among these are React, React Native, Angular, Ionic, Javascript and Typescript.
    I have also had courses covering native mobile development with both swift(iOS) and kotlin(android).
    In addition to this my education also contained courses about Java development, which i enjoy aswell.
    We have also carried out multiple projects in school where we have worked in groups. 
    Through these projects i have learned a lot about teamwork and scrum, which we have used in every project.
    Throughout my working experience i have mostly used React.js. I enjoy working with the framework and find it challenging, which keeps me motivated.
    Furthermore i am actively looking for jobs as a developer in Oslo. I am really enjoying my programming currently and can not wait to start my carreer.`;
